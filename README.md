## EMVA Standard 1288
![EMVA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92443490/159484319-394a24ef-433c-4ce3-9343-60d90512708f.png)


The different parameters that describe the characteristics and quality of a sensor are gathered and coherently described in the [EMVA 1288](https://www.emva.org/standards-technology/emva-1288/). 

I would highly recommend that you carefully read and understand this document before starting any operation.

This standard illustrates the fundamental parameters that must be given to fully describe the real behavior of a sensor, together with the well-defined measurement methods to get these parameters. 

The standard parameters are:
- Dark current [ADU/s]
- Quantum efficiency [%]
- Readout noise [e-]
- Gain [ADU/e-]
- Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [dB]
- Dynamic range (DR) [dB]
- Saturation (full-well) capacity [e-] 
- Photo-Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) [%]
