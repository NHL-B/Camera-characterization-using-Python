### EMVA Standard 1288

The different parameters that describe the characteristics and quality of a sensor are gathered and coherently described in the [EMVA 1288](https://www.emva.org/standards-technology/emva-1288/). This standard illustrates the fundamental parameters that must be given to fully describe the real behavior of a sensor, together with the well-defined measurement methods to get these parameters.

The standard parameters are:
- Dark current (temperature dependence: optional)
- Read noise
- Photon Transfer Curve (PTC) is a logâ€‘log plot of noise versus signal for a digital sensor
- Signal-to-noise ratio
